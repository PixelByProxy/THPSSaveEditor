# THPS2 Save Editor
This editor features the ability to edit your THPS2 PC and 
PlayStation saved games. Just open up your PC (*.sav) or PlayStation 
(*.psx) save and manipulate your save any way you want!

This version is probably going to be the last version of this editor
unless I come up with some more ideas. Enjoy the final/complete
release.

## DexDrive Users
If you are using a DexDrive with this program, you will first need 
to convert your save to .psx format. This can easily be done using 
PSX Game Edit available from http://moberg-dybdal.dk/psxge/
